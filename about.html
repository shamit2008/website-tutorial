    <h2 style = "text-align:center">How we get this information. </h2>
    <h2>There are four main ways.</h2>
    <br>
    <h4>1. OpenWPM</h4>
        <br>
        <p style = "text-align:center">The main way we check web security is  through a web-crawler called openwpm. 
            This web crawler internally runs the website and then tracks the data 
            pulls. We filter these to only show data collected from the user, i
            nstead of images and other things.We then run it through our formula that gives out 
            a number. Over 1000 is yellow, and over 3000 is red.
        </p>
        <br>
    <h4>2. Cookies</h4>
        <br>
        <p style = "text-align: center"> Cookies are little bits of information that are 
            stored and then sent to the server about the user. 
            This is almost as important in our formula as the 
            web-crawler data, but not as much. Not all cookies 
            are put on by the website developer. 
            Google sets hundreds of millions of them all 
            together. We then plug this number into our formula. 
            500 is medium, and 1000 is dangerous.</p>
