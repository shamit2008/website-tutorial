 Hello World
git status - the status of your docs

    staged vs unstaged:
        staged means ready to send to GitHub (commit)
        unstaged means not ready yet
        Ex: you change a line of here. if you don't want to send it, leave it as unstaged. if you want to send it, stage it
    
    to stage:
        git add 'file name'
        git add . (stages all unstaged files)
    
    committing:
        making your files committed to send to Github
        you can't unstage files from here, they're committed to changing
    
    to commit:
        git commit -m "whatever message here, usually say what you changed"

    pushing/pulling:
        pushing = sends committed files from your local repository to GitHub's repository
        pulling = get all changes from online
    
    to push:
        git push origin master
    
    look up Git basic commands
    TLDR:
        write your files, save files
        git status to make sure they're fine
        git add .
        git commit -m "message"
        git push origin master

    Steps:
        1. write stuff, add files, etc
            1a. save everything
        2. open terminal
            - cd Desktop
            - cd website-tutorial
        3. git status and check that all files there are correct
        4. git add .
        5. git commit -m "message"
        6. git push origin
        7. check github online to make sure changes are there
